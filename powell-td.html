/*
Did not finish

Alright so the strategy is is first choose a randm spot until you hit. 
once you hit, you know for a fact that the ship can be layed verticlly or horizontally.
Try out horizontally first.
first left then right. If left, keep going left until you sink or miss
if not sunk, try right nad keep going right until you sink or miss.

if nothing was sunk this way go vertical until you sink something

if all  failed and ypu sunk nothing, its one of the two corner cases and you have to try again.
